# PING-PONG
developing a simple Ping-Pong game using Pygame! It combined my passion for gaming with coding, and taught me a lot about:  ✅ Game loops and real-time updates ✅ Drawing and moving game objects (paddles &amp; ball) ✅ Handling keyboard input for smooth gameplay, Collision detection and game logic, Managing frame-rate for consistent motion
